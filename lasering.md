# Important laser rules
1. **DON'T WALK AWAY FROM A RUNNING LASER** - every makerspace eventually burns down due to lasers. We suggest bringing a stool and your computer with you. Unattended cuts will be interrupted and the user may have their access revoked.
1. Only use approved materials - materials already in the Lab are pre-approved, but you will need to check with Prototyping Lab staff if you want to cut or engrave something else.

# Making a basic laser chassis (no design experience needed)

1. Choose from one of the templates made by our staff, downloading the file as an svg.
    1. Formula E by Aayush Kumar (Cohort 7). [SVG here.](/CAD/svg/RC_Car_Formula-E/RC_Car_Formula-E_layout.svg)

1. Ask a member of staff to invite you to the Glowforge system. You will need to sign up for an account, but it is free. Please skip any features that ask for a credit card.
    1. You will get an email and you'll need to click "Click here to get started." Feel free to skip the tutorials.
1. "Create a new design" and "Upload a file" in the [Glowforge interface](https://app.glowforge.com)

1. Find the 1/8" MDF in the laser material storage and put a sheet of it in your laser on the black honeycomb tray. Position doesn't matter much, and you can close the lid once you have the piece in. If you can, try to use pieces that already have something cut out of them. The numbers in the top right of the Glowforge interface indicate which laser is yours. The number on the machine is near the barcode.
1. You will need to set the material to "Medium Draftboard" in the top left of the Glowforge interface. You may have to search using the search box.

    1. Greyed out parts are ones outside the Glowforge's cuttable area and will need to be moved onto the material.

1. Add any additional features you might want. [Here is a file with some pieces you can scale and move around in the Glowforge interface.](/CAD/svg) There is a download symbol on each of these pages that you'll need to use.

1. In the Glowforge interface, click and drag those pieces around on the generated box pieces to place them where you want them. Be careful not to accidentally scale the pieces from the template, but the other pieces can be scaled to your liking.

1. Set the text to "Ignore."

    ![Image showing where Ignore is found](/assets/laser_tutorial/glowforge_ignore.svg)

1. Make sure that all of your parts are on the material in the laser and are not greyed out. You can box select groups of them and move them around.
    1. If you are using scraps, you can move items you don't want to cut outside the cuttable area. Anything greyed out won't be cut, which is sometimes desirable.
1. Click "Print" in the top right of the interface.

    ![Image showing the Print button](/assets/laser_tutorial/glowforge_print.svg)

1. Press the big glowing button on the Glowforge and stay to watch your cut. Watching your cut is important as fires are common in lasers.
1. Once the laser has stopped making noise, you can open the lid and pull the parts out (don't worry, they aren't hot).
1. You've made your first box! Test it out and iterate!
