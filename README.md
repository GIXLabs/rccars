# Purpose
To provide instructions to how to make a RC car.  

# Instructions for building the rccar
1. Stack the **motor board** on top of the **brain board**. 

2. Take the **motors** and connect the wires to the motor board. You might need to see if the wheels are turning to the right direction.

4. Cut a board to make it as the bottom of the rccar. Make sure it holds everything!

5. Stick the motors to the board you just cut. Also connect the wheels to the motors. 

6. Attach the battery to the car and you are ready to go. 


# Instructions for starting the car
1. Get an android phone and open the **Bluetooth RC Car**. 

2. Click on the option menu and then click on "Connect to car". You should be able to see the car's number in the list.

3. After you're connected, you are ready to go! 

4. To change the speed of the car, you would need to learn how to flash the code, go [here](https://github.com/GIXLabs/rccars/blob/main/tutorials/flash_code.md).
